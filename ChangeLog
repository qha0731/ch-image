	* src/imageops.cl:
	transform-image now returns a copy of the image instead of messing up
	the original image. This is probably the right thing to do since we
	needed to copy the image data anyway. Might as well leave the original
	untouched.

	* ChangeLog: updating changelogs

	* src/imageops.cl:
	compute a default region for the transform if none is given now

	* src/ch-image.cl: added more set-channels methods

	* src/imageops.cl: added gaussian-blur-image

	* src/ch-image.cl: added set-channels method

2005-07-13  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/imageops.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/ch-image.cl:
	added get-channels method and impls
	added affine-transform-image method
	exported a couple symbols

2005-07-06  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* ch-image.asd: removed registry stuff.

	* test/test-ch-image.cl: removed describe calls
	util -> ch-util

	* src/ch-image.cl:
	make matrix-gray-image use height for rows and width for cols
	instead of vice versa.

2005-07-01  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* Makefile: adding makefile

	* LICENSE, README, ch-image.asd: added LICENSE and README

	* ChangeLog: added ChangeLog

	* bootstrap.cl, ch-image-test.asd, ch-image.asd, src/ch-image.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/imageops.cl, test/defpackage.cl, test/test-ch-image.cl:
	image package -> ch-image

2005-07-01  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* bootstrap.cl, ch-image-test.asd, ch-image.asd, src/ch-image.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/imageops.cl, test/defpackage.cl, test/test-ch-image.cl:
	image package -> ch-image

2005-06-23  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/ch-image.cl: set-image-data had mixed up rows and cols

	* ch-image-test.asd: syncing up package changes
	   ... matrix -> clem
	   ... tiff went away, replaced by imageio and tiff-uffi

2005-06-15  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* ch-image.asd, ch-image-test.asd: more asdf cleanup

	cleaning up the local file path thingy. We used to do it relative to
	  the *load-truename*, now we cache the *load-truename* of the .asd
	  file in a special variable in the tiff-uffi-system package. Then we
	  build our file paths relative to that.

	* src/ch-image.cl: * The big unsigned-byte -> ub8 and friends rename.
	  ... Now use ub32-matrix instead of unsigned-long matrix.
	      Some folks might hate the numbers, but word and long were
	      just too vague and all of those unsigned ints are in fact
	      bytes to lisp anyway!

2005-06-14  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* ch-image.asd, ch-image-test.asd:
	cleaned up asdf file logic a bit. Now there's a piece of code that
	  needs to go in each .asd file, but we don't get screwy behavior
	  based on partial overriding of asdf methods. Now each system gets
	  its own subclass of cl-source-file type and components are specified
	  as :clem-cl-source-file, for instance, instead of :file. Files
	  usually have .cl as the suffix, but this is easily changeable on a
	  per-system basis and fasls go in a separate directory.

2005-05-16  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/ch-image.cl, test/test-ch-image.cl:
	ok, all the images are now in row-major order.

2005-05-12  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/defpackage.cl: use clem instead of matrix.

	* src/ch-image.cl: use clem instead of matrix.
	use row-major indexing.

	* ch-image.asd: now depends on clem instead of matrix.

2005-04-26  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/imageops.cl: fixed an ignore declaration

	* src/ch-image.cl: cleaned up initargs stuff.

2004-10-25  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* src/ch-image.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/imageops.cl, test/test-ch-image.cl:
	first (real) version of pipeline works now for both manual and auto-seg stuff.
	trying to resolve how to deal with image/matrix split. works for now.

2004-10-20  Cyrus Harmon  <cyrus@bobobeach.com>

	* .cvsignore, bootstrap.cl, ch-image-test.asd, ch-image.asd, src/.cvsignore, src/ch-image.cl, src/defpackage.cl, src/imageops.cl, test/.cvsignore, test/defpackage.cl, test/test-ch-image.cl:
	moving to new home.
